Introducing: Project Open Data

Technology is evolving faster than the policies used to govern them.  Often we find ourselves working within outdated policy frameworks that have not kept pace with modern tools and technology.  Last week when the President launched the new Open Data Policy and Executive Order, we didn’t want to make the same mistake. We wanted to create a culture change in government where we embrace collaboration; where anyone can help us make open data work better. 

The President called on his Administration to propose a new way of developing and implementing policy, and we responded with Project Open Data.

Project Open Data is an online, public repository intended to foster collaboration and promote the continual improvement of the Open Data Policy. The project was published on GitHub (http://www.github.com), an open source platform that allows communities of developers to collaboratively share and enhance code.  The resources and tools in Project Open Data can help accelerate the adoption of open data practices.  For example, one tool instantly converts spreadsheets and databases into APIs for easier consumption by developers.  The idea is that anyone, from state and local governments to private citizens, can freely use, adapt and add to these open source tools—and that’s exactly what’s happening.

Within the first 24 hours that Project Open Data was published, over two dozen contributions (or “pull requests” in GitHub parlance) were submitted by the public. The submissions included everything from fixing broken links, to providing policy suggestions, to contributing new code and tools. One pull request even included new code to that translates geographic data from locked formats accessible only through proprietary software into data that is freely available for use by anyone.

These steps may seem small, but they represent a big shift. Behind these actions is recognition of the simple fact that as a community, we can do more together than we can alone. Project Open Data bridges the old model of top down requirements and grumbling of unfunded mandates into a new paradigm that leverages the ingenuity of the American people as partners to work with us in solving the most pressing challenges of our time.  

We are excited to test this new model of policy development and implementation. We invite you to add your own contributions to Project Open Data, and hope you will participate in transforming our government for the 21st century.

Project Open Data Primer:
Additionally, here’s a quick primer outlining the process and roles of how we plan on operating Project Open Data:

*Contributing:*  Project Open Data is a collaborative, open source project.  Everyone is strongly encouraged to improve the project by contributing.  You don't need to be a Federal employees, an State, or even a contractor at a big company.  You just need good ideas about how to make the project better. Fortunately, contributing is very easy. Simply click the “Improve this content” button at the top of every page, make your edit, and hit “submit.” Your changes will appear once they are approved. Additional instructions are can be found here. 

*Advisory members:*  In addition to White House staff, we have a small number of advisory members who are actively involved in the project. They are helping to facilitate conversations and general maintenance for the project. This is an invitational roll.  Additional members may be added based on contributions and commitment to the project.

*Owners:* Project Open Data is managed by the White House’s Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). As the Federal CIO and CTO, we both plan to be actively involved in this exciting project and are looking forward to merging many more “pull requests” along the way. Members of our teams will also be involved in maintaining the project.

*Approving changes:*  In GitHub speak, Project Open Data is actually a collection of different little-p “projects” housed in individual repositories, or “repos.” Each individual project repo will be managed as an open source project – i.e., users can make pull requests (suggest changes).  A repo manager will adjudicate the pull requests (accept, modify, or reject) in a public log on a standard release cycle. Changes to relevant policy areas will be reviewed and approved by relevant policy officials.  We will document and carry out these conversations within Project Open Data through issues and comments. 

*Timing:* White House owners will have regular “stand ups” to review the “pull requests” and ensure suggestions are addressed in a reasonable time frame.  Changes that are relatively minor (e.g., typos, minor edits) should be approved fairly quickly, while more substantial changes may take longer to review and approve with necessary White House stakeholders.
